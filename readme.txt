# Heart-Disease-Prediction-SVM
It is a web app which can predict if the person has heart disease or not, it uses SVM algorithm.

# Instructions
Following are the details about each of the input field and selectable options.
    -age, Float

    -sex - Category
        0 = female
        1 = male

    -cp, chest pain, Category
        1 = typical angina,
        2 = atypical angina,
        3 = non-anginal pain,
        4 = asymptomatic

    -restbp, resting blood pressure (in mm Hg), Float

    -chol, serum cholesterol in mg/dl, Float

    -fbs, fasting blood sugar, Category
        0 = >=120 mg/dl
        1 = <120 mg/dl

    -restecg, resting electrocardiographic results, Category
        1 = normal
        2 = having ST-T wave abnormality
        3 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy

    -thalach, maximum heart rate achieved, Float

    -exang, exercise induced angina, Category
        0 = no
        1 = yes

    -oldpeak, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. Float

    -slope, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, Category
        1 = upsloping
        2 = flat
        3 = downsloping

    -ca, number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy, Float

    -thal, thalium heart scan, Category
        3 = normal (no cold spots)
        6 = fixed defect (cold spots during rest and exercise)
        7 = reversible defect (when cold spots only appear during exercise)
